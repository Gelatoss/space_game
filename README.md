# Space Game

## Overview
A simple space-themed ship game I developed in 2020.

## Description
This game is a side-scrolling, survival-based space adventure where the player takes control of a spaceship. The objective is to navigate through space while avoiding obstacles such as asteroids. If a collision occurs, the game ends, and the player's score is displayed.
